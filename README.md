###ðŸ§  Core Library for Generative AI

âœ… TensorFlow
Role: Main deep learning framework for building, training, and deploying generative models (e.g. GANs, VAEs, transformers).

Use cases in generative AI:

Building GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for image generation.

Creating VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) for data generation.

Fine-tuning transformer models for text, image, or audio generation.

TensorFlowâ€™s high-level API (tf.keras) is widely used for model building.

ðŸ”¢ Supporting Libraries

âœ… NumPy
Role: Numerical computing.

Use cases in generative AI:

Handling multi-dimensional arrays (tensors).

Pre-processing or transforming data before feeding it into models.

Custom operations not covered by TensorFlow layers.

âœ… Pandas
Role: Data manipulation and analysis.

Use cases in generative AI:

Loading and cleaning structured/tabular datasets (e.g., for text or tabular GANs).

Data exploration before training generative models.

Label alignment, feature engineering.

ðŸ“Š Visualization Libraries

âœ… Matplotlib / Seaborn
Role: Data visualization.

Use cases in generative AI:

Plot training curves (loss, accuracy) during model training.

Visualize generated outputs (e.g., generated images, sequences).

Understand data distributions and training dynamics.

ðŸ”§ Example Use Case

Imagine building a GAN that generates handwritten digits:

Use Pandas to load and explore the MNIST dataset.

Use NumPy for array manipulations.

Build the model with TensorFlow.

Use Matplotlib to visualize generated digits during training.

Use Seaborn to explore feature distributions or loss trends.
